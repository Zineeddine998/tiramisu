# Synthetic Programs generator

The Synthetic Programs Generator's purpose is to generate datasets that can be used to train data-driven Tiramisu cost models. 

The Synthetic Programs Generator generates synthetic Tiramisu programs, distributes their execution on a cluster, performs runtime measurements, and saves the results into dataset files. 


## Usage
The full dataset construction workflow can be executed from the Jupyter notebook 'Dataset_generator.ipynb'. The details of each step are described on the notebook.
