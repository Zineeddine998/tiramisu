This block is used in the VGG19 End to End Architecture
The files in this folder are organized as follows:

    General
        clean.sh : remove some useless files.
        compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh : compile MKL-DNN code and run it.
        configure.h: define some configuration constants.

    Tiramisu
        conv_relu_conv_relu_generator.cpp: Tiramisu code generator.

    Wrapper
        conv_relu_conv_relu_wrapper.cpp: wrapper file that calls the code generated by Tiramisu.

    Intel MKL-DNN
        conv_relu_conv_relu_generator_mkldnn.cpp : code that calls Intel MKL-DNN VGG block.

To run this benchmark:

    At the directory build/benchmarks/DNN/blocks/Conv-ReLU-Conv-ReLU/cpu/sparse_32channels_512_512_14 execute
	    make

    wrapper_sparse_conv_relu_conv_relu_512_512_14 executable will be created in the current directory.

    To compare the result of tiramisu with MKL-DNN execute :
        ./compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh
    then
        ./wrapper_sparse_conv_relu_conv_relu_512_512_14

    execution results could be found in the text files :
        mkl_result.txt (same for Intel MKL-DNN and MKL Sparse)
        tiramisu_result.txt (Tiramisu)
