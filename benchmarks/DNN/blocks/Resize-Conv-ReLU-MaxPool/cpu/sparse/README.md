The files in this folder are organized as follows:

    General
        clean.sh : remove some useless files.
        compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh : compile MKL-DNN code and run it.
        configure.h: define some configuration constants.

    Tiramisu
        resize_spconv_relu_maxpool_generator_tiramisu.cpp: Tiramisu code generator.

    Wrapper
        wrapper_nn_block.cpp: wrapper file that calls the code generated by Tiramisu.

    Intel MKL-DNN
        resize_conv_relu_maxpool_generator_mkldnn.cpp : code that calls Intel MKL-DNN.

    Intel MKL Sparse
        resize_conv_relu_maxpool_generator_mkl_sparse.cpp : code for MKL Sparse implementation (using lowering and spmv)

To run this benchmark:
    (To turn on correctness checking and output to file head to the configure.h file and set CHECK_CORRECTNESS and WRITE_RESULTS_TO_FILE to 1)
    At the directory build/benchmarks/DNN/blocks/Resize-Conv-ReLU-MaxPool/cpu/sparse execute
	    make

    wrapper_nn_block_resize_spconv_relu_maxpool executable will be created in the current directory.

    To compare the result of tiramisu with MKL-DNN execute :
        ./compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh
    then
        ./wrapper_nn_block_resize_spconv_relu_maxpool

    To compare the result of tiramisu with MKL Sparse execute :
        ./compile_and_run_mkl_sparse.sh intel64 (depending on architecture)
    then
        ./wrapper_nn_block_resize_spconv_relu_maxpool

    execution results will be found in the text files :
        mkl_result.txt (same for Intel MKL-DNN and MKL Sparse)
        tiramisu_result.txt (Tiramisu)
