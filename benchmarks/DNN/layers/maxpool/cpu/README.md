The files in this folder are organized as follows:

    General
        clean.sh : remove some useless files.
        compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh : compile mkldnn code and run it. 
        configure.h: define size of input matrices.

    Tiramisu
        maxpool_layer_generator_tiramisu.cpp: Tiramisu code generator.

    Wrapper
        wrapper_nn.cpp: wrapped file that calls the code generated by Tiramisu.

    Intel MKLDNN
        maxpool_layer_generator_mkldnn.cpp: code that calls Intel MKL DNN max pooling function. 

To run this benchmark:

    At the directory build/benchmarks/DNN/layers/maxpool execute 
        make 

    wrapper_nn_maxpool executable will be created in the current directory. to compare the result of tiramisu with MKL DNN execute :
        ./compile_and_run_mkldnn.sh
    then 
        ./wrapper_nn_maxpool

    Execution results could be found in the text files : 
        mkldnn_result.txt
        tiramisu_result.txt
